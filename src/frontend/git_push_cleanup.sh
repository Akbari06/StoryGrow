git commit -m "Clean up and reorganize project structure

- Move backend files (requirements.txt, Dockerfile, etc.) to src/backend/
- Create scripts/ folder for deployment scripts  
- Remove redundant documentation (consolidated into PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md)
- Remove service-account-key.json (security - should never be in git)
- Update .gitignore for better security
- Clean root directory to only essential files

Root now contains only:
- README.md and PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md
- Firebase configuration
- Git/GitHub files
- License
